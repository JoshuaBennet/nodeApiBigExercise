Create a Reminders API. It should be able to do the following things:
- create a new reminder which has the fields **title** (string up to 500 characters) and **done** (boolean)
- mark a reminder as "done"
- delete a reminder
- mark a reminder which is "done" as not "done"
- **new** get all the reminders (optionally filter by whether it's done or not, e.g. get all tasks that are not done)
<h4>The steps you need to do: </h4>
<li>create a mongo database</li>
<li>write API documentation for your RESTful API</li> 
<li>get it approved by senior Dev</li>
<li>implement the API</li>
